B1 Sheet Write Verification - Findings
=====================================

BLOCKER DISCOVERED: sheets_integration.py contains only stub implementation

Evidence:
- Generated 7 slips successfully
- CSV write works correctly  
- Google Sheets authentication confirmed working (sheet_ping.py)
- But sheets_integration.py only contains:
  
  def push_slips_to_sheets(slips):
      """Push slips to Google Sheets - stub implementation."""
      print(f"[Sheets Integration] Would push {len(slips)} slips to Google Sheets")
      return True

This prevents any actual writes to Google Sheets.
