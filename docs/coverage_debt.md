# Coverage Debt Documentation

## Current Coverage Baseline

**Current Coverage: 12%**

As of Sprint-3, the PhaseGrid project has a test coverage baseline of approximately 12%. This is measured using pytest with coverage reporting across the `modules/` and `scripts/` directories.

## Coverage Analysis

### Areas with Coverage
- Basic module imports and initialization
- Core utility functions in modules
- Simple validation functions

### Areas Lacking Coverage
- Complex betting logic in phase mapping
- Kelly criterion calculations
- Sheet connector integration points
- Paper trading simulation logic
- Error handling paths
- Edge cases in payout calculations

## Technical Debt Inventory

1. **Legacy Test Structure** (27 xfailed tests)
   - Tests marked as `xfail` due to outdated implementation
   - Need refactoring to match current architecture

2. **Integration Test Gap**
   - No end-to-end tests for Google Sheets integration
   - Missing tests for complete betting workflows

3. **Mock Dependencies**
   - External API calls not properly mocked
   - File I/O operations need test isolation

## Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sprint 4)
- **Target: 20% coverage**
- Refactor xfailed tests to properly test current implementation
- Add unit tests for core calculation modules
- Implement proper mocking for external dependencies

### Phase 2: Core Logic (Sprint 5)
- **Target: 35% coverage**
- Add comprehensive tests for betting algorithms
- Test Kelly criterion calculations with various scenarios
- Cover phase mapping logic thoroughly

### Phase 3: Integration (Sprint 6)
- **Target: 50% coverage**
- Implement integration tests with mocked Google Sheets
- Test complete workflows from data input to bet output
- Add error handling and edge case tests

### Phase 4: Optimization (Sprint 7)
- **Target: 70% coverage**
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Stress testing betting calculations
- Add property-based testing for mathematical functions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Focus on pure functions first
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data
- Implement parametrized tests for calculation variants

### Integration Testing
- Mock external services (Google Sheets API)
- Test data flow between modules
- Verify configuration loading and validation

### Quality Gates
- Enforce coverage requirements in CI/CD
- Fail builds if coverage drops below baseline
- Regular coverage trend reporting

## Metrics and Monitoring

- Weekly coverage reports
- Track coverage by module
- Identify high-risk uncovered code paths
- Monitor test execution time

## Resources Required

1. **Developer Time**: 20% of sprint capacity for test writing
2. **Tools**: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock
3. **Training**: Team workshop on effective testing strategies
4. **Documentation**: Test writing guidelines and examples

## Success Criteria

- Achieve 70% test coverage by end of Sprint 7
- Zero high-priority bugs in covered code
- All new code requires tests (TDD approach)
- Reduced regression issues in production
