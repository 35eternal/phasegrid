# PG-109: Menstrual Cycle Tracking & Prediction - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the core PhaseGrid vision: menstrual cycle-aware performance prediction for WNBA players.

## Demo Results
The working demo shows real cycle-based adjustments:

### Test Player 1 (Ovulatory Phase - Peak Performance)
- Base projection: 25.5 points → 27.5 points (+8%)
- Steals: 2.1 → 2.4 (+15% - highest boost)
- Assists: 5.5 → 6.2 (+12%)
- Rebounds: 8.2 → 9.0 (+10%)

### Test Player 2 (Menstrual Phase - Lower Baseline)
- Base projection: 25.5 points → 23.5 points (-8%)
- Steals: 2.1 → 1.8 (-13% - biggest drop)
- Rebounds: 8.2 → 7.2 (-12%)
- Assists: 5.5 → 5.0 (-10%)

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Core Module (`phasegrid/cycle_tracker.py`)
- **CycleEntry dataclass**: Privacy-compliant data structure with UUID-based player IDs
- **CycleTracker class**: Manages cycle data ingestion and phase-based modifiers
- **Phase modifier calculation**: Adjusts projections based on cycle phase
- **Confidence scoring**: Weights modifiers based on data reliability
- **Stale data handling**: Ignores data older than 35 days

### 2. Configuration System
- **cycle_config.yaml**: Human-readable configuration
- **cycle_config.json**: Dependency-free JSON alternative
- **Phase-specific modifiers**: Different multipliers for each prop type
- **Privacy settings**: Opt-in requirement, 2-year data retention

### 3. Test Suite (`tests/test_cycle_tracker.py`)
- 12 comprehensive unit tests - **ALL PASSING** ✅
- Coverage areas: serialization, ingestion, modifiers, privacy compliance

### 4. Integration Tools
- **integration_example.py**: Code snippets for SlipOptimizer integration
- **demo_cycle_tracking.py**: Working demonstration of cycle tracking

## Performance Modifiers by Phase

| Phase | Base | Points | Rebounds | Assists | Steals | Blocks |
|-------|------|--------|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Follicular | 1.05 | 1.03 | 1.05 | 1.04 | 1.06 | 1.02 |
| Ovulatory | 1.10 | 1.08 | 1.10 | 1.12 | 1.15 | 1.08 |
| Luteal | 0.95 | 0.96 | 0.94 | 0.95 | 0.93 | 0.95 |
| Menstrual | 0.90 | 0.92 | 0.88 | 0.90 | 0.87 | 0.89 |

## Privacy & Compliance
- ✅ UUID-only player identification (no PII)
- ✅ Opt-in required before data collection
- ✅ 2-year rolling data retention window
- ✅ Confidence scoring for data quality

## Integration Status
- Module is standalone and ready for integration
- Requires player name → UUID mapping system
- Can be toggled on/off via configuration
- Backward compatible (returns base projection if no data)

## Key Achievement
PhaseGrid now has a working, privacy-compliant menstrual cycle tracking system that adjusts player performance projections based on cycle phase, fulfilling the project's core vision. The demo proves the system works exactly as designed, with meaningful performance adjustments that could provide a competitive edge in prop betting.

## Next Steps
1. Implement player name → UUID mapping in production
2. Integrate with real SlipOptimizer
3. Set up secure cycle data ingestion pipeline
4. Create admin interface for cycle data management
5. Backtest with historical WNBA performance data
